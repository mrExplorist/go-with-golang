The choice between using a mutex (`RLock`/`RUnlock`) or directly locking a resource (`score := []int{0}`) depends on the specific requirements and use case of your program. Let's consider the scenarios where each approach is appropriate:

1. **Using Mutex (`RLock`/`RUnlock`)**: If you have a shared resource, such as an array `score` that will be accessed by multiple goroutines concurrently, and you need to perform both read and write operations on it, using a mutex is recommended. A mutex provides safe access to the shared resource by allowing multiple goroutines to read (`RLock`) simultaneously while preventing write (`Lock`) operations from being performed concurrently. For example:

   ```go
   var (
       score []int
       mutex sync.RWMutex
   )

   func readScore() {
       mutex.RLock()
       defer mutex.RUnlock()

       fmt.Println(score)
   }

   func writeScore() {
       mutex.Lock()
       defer mutex.Unlock()

       // Perform write operations on score
   }
   ```

   In this case, `RLock` and `RUnlock` allow multiple goroutines to read the value of `score` concurrently while preventing concurrent writes. It ensures safe access to the shared resource, protecting against race conditions.

2. **Directly Locking the Resource**: If you have a resource that is not shared among multiple goroutines or doesn't require concurrent access, such as a local variable or a resource accessed by a single goroutine, directly initializing or modifying the resource without using a mutex is generally acceptable. For example:

   ```go
   score := []int{0}

   // Perform operations on score
   ```

   In this case, since there is no shared access or concurrent modification, there is no risk of race conditions, and using a mutex is not necessary.

Consider your specific requirements and the context in which the resource will be accessed. If it needs to be shared among multiple goroutines or requires concurrent access, using a mutex with appropriate locking (`RLock`/`RUnlock` or `Lock`/`Unlock`) is a good approach. On the other hand, if the resource is not shared or accessed concurrently, using a mutex may introduce unnecessary complexity.

Remember to assess the specific needs and potential race conditions of your program to determine the most appropriate approach for handling shared resources.

This repository contains code files and resources for learning Go programming language. It covers various topics, including basic syntax, data types, control structures, functions, concurrency, and more.

## [Go Concurrency and Goroutines](Notes/concurrencyandgoroutines.md)

## [Mutex](Code/27mutexAndAwaitGroup)

## Getting Started

To get started with learning Go, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from the official website: [https://golang.org](https://golang.org).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-learning.git
   ```

3. Explore the code examples and resources available in the repository.
4. Make sure to open each directory in separate VS Code instance to avoid any `modules not found in the workspace issues`

## Code Examples

The repository contains code examples organized into directories based on different topics. Each directory may contain multiple Go files, and useful comments in each file and there may be a separate README file within each directory that provides details about the code examples and explanations of the concepts covered.
Here are some of the directories and their corresponding topics:

> Feel free to explore the directories, read the code, and experiment with running the examples to deepen your understanding of Go.

## Resources

In addition to code examples, this repository provides a collection of learning resources that can be helpful in mastering Go. Here are some recommended resources:

- [Official Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/): The official documentation is an invaluable resource for learning Go. It covers language specifications, standard libraries, and provides comprehensive examples and explanations.

- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1): The interactive tour is a great way to get started with Go. It provides hands-on exercises that introduce various language features, including concurrency.
